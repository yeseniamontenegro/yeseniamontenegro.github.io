            <p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, dozens of universities across the country no longer required SAT
                or ACT score submissions for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 school years.
            </p>

            <p>Since 2021, prospective students have the option to decide whether or not they want their SAT or ACT
                scores
                to be considered when applying to the University of Maryland. Because many SAT and ACT testing dates
                were canceled or postponed during the height of the pandemic, many colleges have adopted test-optional
                applications, or plan to de-emphasize test scores when reviewing undergraduate applications.
                Now, applications to UMD are evaluated “holistically,” meaning that all parts of an application are
                analyzed, no matter if an applicant submits a test score or not, according to the university’s written
                admission policy.
            </p>

            <h2>Changing scores</h2>

            <p>A review of standardized testing submissions when required shows little variance, but when optional
                testing is submitted, the average scores appear to be higher.
            </p>

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>From 2017 to 2020, the average SAT score prospective students submitted with their application
                        was between
                        <span class="number">1375</span> and <span class="number">1380</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2021 however, when SAT scores
                        became
                        optional, the average was
                        <span class="number">1430</span>.
                    </p>


                </div>
            </div>

            <br>
            <p> This raises the question-: Do test-optional applications allow more students to be admitted, because
                only those with high SAT scores are submitting results, or are more students being admitted without
                their scores being considered? </p>



            <p>According to university research platform <a href="https://www.cappex.com/colleges/sat/1400"
                    target="_blank">Cappex,</a> a score
                of 1400 on the SAT places a student in the 95th percentile, meaning they
                have
                scored
                higher than 95% of test takers. The average score at UMD is now even higher than the 95th
                percentile.
            </p>

            <p>This could also mean that if and/or when UMD decides to require test scores again, the minimum they
                are looking for may be higher. The average SAT score in 2021 is <span class="number">55 </span>
                points higher than in
                previous years, which may
                not
                seem
                like
                a lot, but can make a significant difference when applying to colleges. Now that the average is so
                much higher, and will probably stay at a higher score in 2022 and 2023, getting accepted to UMD has
                the potential to be more difficult in the future.
            </p>

            <h2>Admission numbers</h2>

            <p>Data shows that there are already significant differences in application and admission numbers.
                In 2021, UMD received more than <span class="number">50,000</span> applications, up from the
                <span class="number">32,000</span> received in 2020.
                However, only
                <span class="number">40%</span>
                of applicants were admitted in 2021, while <span class="number">51% </span>were admitted in 2020.
                While there is no evidence
                that
                there
                is a direct correlation between the two, it is interesting to note that significantly more students
                were
                admitted when the average SAT score was lower and submission was required.

            <p>Freshman Krissy Verma, a kinesiology major, submitted her SAT score to UMD, but not to two other
                schools she applied to. She felt her score was high enough for UMD, but might not have been enough
                for some of her other options.</p>

            <p>Verma started studying for the exam three months in advance, and spent at least two hours a day
                studying, she said. Because of how much effort went into it, she thinks it still made sense to
                submit her score. However, since a lot of students might not have had the opportunity to fully prepare
                for the exam, or even take it because of the pandemic, test-optional was a fair way of admitting
                students, she said.</p>

                    week when
                    preparing for the SAT. With so much time being put in, deciding whether or not to submit scores
                    can be a tough decision. (Photo: Yesenia Montenegro)

            <p>UMD Freshman Shreeya Patel, who applied in 2021, decided to submit her SAT score, despite there being
                no
                requirement.
            </p>

            <p>“I had already spent a lot of time studying and my score wasn’t that bad. It was in the range of
                scores
                that
                UMD requires, so I went ahead and submitted it anyway because I had invested so much time already,”
                Patel
                said.
            </p>

            <p>Even though she submitted her score, Patel likes that it is not required. She feels that a test score
                should
                not be the basis on which admission should be decided, because it doesn’t necessarily show how well
                a
                student can perform in higher education, she said.
            </p>
