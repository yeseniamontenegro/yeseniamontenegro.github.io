            <p1><b>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</b><br></p1>
            <p1><br>Figure skating is a sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It
                was
                the
                first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games, when contested at the 1908 Olympics in London.
                The Olympic disciplines are men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance; the four
                individual
                disciplines are also combined into a team event, first included in the Winter Olympics in 2014. The
                non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From
                intermediate
                through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (the short program and the free
                skate), which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw
                jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.</p1>
            <h3>Olympic Disciplines</h3>
            <p1>As an Olympic sport, figure skating comprises the following disciplines:</p1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Singles</b> competitions for men and for women (previously referred to as "ladies" in ISU
                    rulebooks
                    until the 2021-22 season). Individual skaters perform jumps, spins, step sequences, spirals, and
                    other
                    elements in their programs.</li>
                <li><b>Pair skating</b> teams, consisting of a woman and a man skating together. Pairs perform elements
                    that
                    are specific to the discipline such as: throw jumps, in which the man 'throws' the woman into a
                    jump;
                    lifts, in which the woman is held above the man's head in one of various grips and positions; pair
                    spins, in which both skaters spin together about a common axis; death spirals; and other elements
                    such
                    as side-by-side jumps and spins in unison.</li>
                <li><b>Ice dance</b> couples, consisting of a man and a woman skating together. In contrast to pair
                    skating,
                    ice dance focuses on intricate footwork performed in close dance holds, in time with the music. Ice
                    dance lifts must not go above the shoulder, while throws and jumps are disallowed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p1>The four disciplines of men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance, are also
                incorporated
                into a team event which appeared on the Olympic programme for the first time at the 2014 Winter
                Olympics.
            </p1>
            <h3>Spins</h3>
            <p1>Spins are a required element in all four Olympic disciplines. There are three basic positions - upright,
                sit
                and camel - with numerous variations. Spins may be performed individually or in a spin sequence,
                combining
                different types of spin; a spin sequence is known as a "combination spin". During a spin, the skater
                rotates
                on the front rocker (sometimes called the "sweet spot" or "spin rocker"), which is the curved part of
                the
                blade that corresponds to the ball of the skater's foot, just behind the toe pick. A spin may be
                executed on
                the back rocker of the blade during a change of edge spin. For example, a back scratch spin will flip
                edges
                to a forward inside edge. This feature of a spin will change the level of a spin.</p1>
            <h3>Jumps</h3>
            <p1>Jumps involve the skater leaping into the air and rotating rapidly to land after completing one or more
                rotations. There are many types of jumps, identified by the way the skater takes off and lands, as well
                as
                by the number of rotations that are completed.Each jump receives a score according to its base value and
                grade of execution. Quality of execution, technique, height, speed, flow and ice coverage are considered
                by
                the judges. An under-rotated jump is "missing rotation of more than 1/4, but less than 1/2 revolution"
                and
                receives 70% of the base value. A downgraded jump is "missing rotation of 1/2 revolution or more." A
                downgraded triple is treated as a double jump, while a downgraded double is treated as a single jump.
